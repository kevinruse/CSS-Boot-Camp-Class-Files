<h1>CSS contain property</h1>
<article>
	<h2>Removing an element from the CSS content tree</h2>
	<p>Per: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain</p>
	<p>The contain CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible,
		independent of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size,
		or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance
		benefits.</p>

	<p>This property is useful on pages that contain a lot of widgets that are all independent, as it can be used to
		prevent each widget's internals from having side effects outside of the widget's bounding-box.</p>
