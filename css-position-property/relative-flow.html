<h1>Relative Flow</h1>
<p>Relatively positioned elements are positioned the same as statically positioned elements, unless the <code>top, bottom, left or right</code> properties are added. Elements positioned with the additional properties (top, bottom, left, right) leave the normal document flow, but the space they took up in the document isnâ€™t collapsed. The space stays open and in the same spot the element originally occupied, regardless of where the element moves via the additional CSS properties. Thus, the surrounding elements will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the relatively positioned element.</p>
