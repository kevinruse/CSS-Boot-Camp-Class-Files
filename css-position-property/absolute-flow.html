<h1>Absolute Positioning</h1>
<p>Absolutely positioned elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor using the top, bottom, left and right properties. If the element has no ancestors the body element is used to determine the relative position. An absolutely positioned element leaves the normal document flow and sit on top of the normal document. The space that would have been occupied by the absolute positioned element in the normal document flow is collapsed. Absolutely positioned elements will scroll with the page content when the page is scrolled.</p>
