	<h1>Creating Multi-Columns with CSS</h1>
	<section id="intro">
		<p>The multi-column specification defines content that can be laid out in columns. Multi-column layout is defined in a CSS Module specification. The editor’s draft may be found at http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-multicol/. The specification is a Level 1 module.
		<p>The main benefit of multi-column layout is the autoflow of text from one column to another. The size of the
			viewport (device screen size) can affect the number of columns to display, making it an ideal choice for the
			responsive design of long text blocks. Multi-column layout is designed for the display of text like a magazine
			or newspaper typography and is not the correct choice for laying out columns of content such as images or
			tables.</p>
		<p>The specification, while widely supported by modern browsers, contains a lot of properties, and many browsers do
			not have 100% support, particularly from Firefox and Chrome versions prior to 61. See caniuse.com for the current
			state of browser support for columns.</p>

			<h3>Creating multi-column layout</h3>
			<p>Columns are created by setting either column widths or the desired number of columns as shown in the two
				examples below.</p>
			<p>The div element below will display columns that are at least ‘10em’ wide. The exact number of columns
				will depend on the available space in the div element.</p>
			<code>
				<pre>
	div { column-width: 10em }</pre>
			</code>

			<p>In the div element below, the number of columns is fixed at three and the column widths will vary depending on
				the available space in the div element.</p>
			<code>
				<pre>
	div { column-count: 3 }</pre>
			</code>

			<p>A shorthand technique looks like this:</p>
			<code><pre>
	div { columns: 3 }
	div { columns: 10em }
	div { columns: 3 10em }</pre></code>

		<section id="columnProperties">
			<h3>Column properties</h3>
			<p>The multi-column specification defines several other properties that control the look of the multi-column content. Excerpts from the specification follow below. The entire Multi-Column Specification can be found at: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-multicol/.
			</p>
			<h3>Column related design issues</h3>
			<p>Since the specification was first released, the main issue facing developers was the lack of support for the
				entire set of column-related properties, namely those in the column-fill and column-breaks. As of this writing,
				browser support has improved significantly. See caniuse.com for the latest information. Additional areas of
				concern are padding, and margins set on element within columns. The break properties behavior is inconsistent
				among browsers and until it has full implementation, it leaves much to be desired in terms of professional
				looking typography.</p>
			<p>When it comes to columns of long flowing text, extra attention must be paid to general typographic features such
				as widows and hyphenation, particularly on responsive columns as the designer cannot predict where words and
				lines will break. You may need to brush up on your text-related CSS properties such as hyphens and
				word-wrap.</p>
